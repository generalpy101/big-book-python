## Project Structure

```
- main_directory
  - project1
    - venv
    - src
  - project2
    - venv
    - src
```

- Each project will have its own [Virtual Environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) which will help us to keep each project's dependencies separated.
- Virtual environment folder is named venv.
- Project's source code will be in src directory.
- Main code will be in main.py file.
- Rest of the code will be in directories like utils (if any) and directories for assets like images will be named accordingly.
