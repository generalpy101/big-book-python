# Bagels

This is project #1 which is bagels game.


Bagels is a deductive logic game. You have to guess a secret 3 digit number in it.

### Rules are :
- You will have 10 tries
- Depending on you guess there are 3 cases :
  - Guess has a correct digit in wrong place. In this case program will output *"Pico"*.
  - Guess has correct number at correct place. In this case program will output *"Fermi"*.
  - Guess has no correct digits. In this case program will output *"Bagels"*.
  

## Approach


We will use pyton strings for easy processing of input. 

By using strings we can easily compare user input and secret number.

`random` module will be used to generate random number.
